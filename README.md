# Portfolio_Ala-too
It is my first experience with html css so this website is very ugly, yet I like it anyways

Project for Ala-too
link to a website: kriptos23.github.io/Portfolio_Ala-too/

So basically it is an amazing project for university course. Actually I found this project useful for learning html, css and js.
However I did not really want to study web cuz I want to become Java developer(probably).
